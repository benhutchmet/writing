            Interaction between synoptic eddy and mean flow plays a crucial role in maintaining midlatitude westerly jet. In this study, climatologies of synoptic eddy activities and their feedback onto midlatitude jet for 1980–2016 are evaluated and compared through analyzing daily data from five atmospheric reanalyses with different resolutions including one coarse-resolution reanalysis (NCEP2) and four fine-resolution reanalyses (ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2, and CFSR). Horizontal resolutions of the atmospheric models generating those reanalyses are approximately equivalent to 210, 79, 60, 50, and 38 km, respectively. Results show that the eddy activities and their feedback onto the midlatitude jet in those fine-resolution reanalyses are consistently and significantly stronger than those in the coarse-resolution reanalysis (NCEP2). The maximal relative increases that are found to occur primarily in the midlatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere are estimated to be up to 55\% for the baroclinicity, 53\% for the eddy energetics, 59\% for the eddy forcing, and even 85\% for the eddy feedback onto the mean flow. Those increases are reasonably conjectured to be related to increased model resolutions, since the synoptic eddy genesis is proportional to the low-level atmospheric meridional temperature gradient which is sensitive to the meridional resolution of atmospheric models. Although the coarse-resolution reanalysis resolves synoptic eddies insufficiently and thus underestimates their feedback onto the mean flow, the magnitudes of eddy-driven jets are almost the same among five reanalyses, implying a mismatch between the eddy feedback and the eddy-driven jet in the coarse-resolution reanalysis. Therefore, the results of this study imply the importance of using fine-resolution reanalyses in accurately understanding the midlatitude synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.},
